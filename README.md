# Class-Work

Repository saving work from the Linear Systems lab I took in Fall 2021. The labs are as follows (and do not have a fully sequential numbering scheme
and are labeled as the instructor originallly did so):

Lab1: Learning Matlab basics
Lab3: Learning basics- energy and power calculations
Lab4: Learning basics - convolution and noise reduction
Lab6: Reducing echo in a digital communications signal.
Lab8: Building a lowpass and bandpass filter using the window method.
Lab10: Shifting an audio signal into the frequency domain then back to the time domain. 
Lab11: Vowel recognition based on spectral energy distribution and nearest neighbor classification.
Lab13: A PID controller for a robot to maintain a certain distance from a wall.
